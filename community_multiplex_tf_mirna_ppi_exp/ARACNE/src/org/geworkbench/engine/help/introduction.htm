     <h2>Welcome to geWorkbench!</h2> 
    <p>geWorkbench is an open-source bioinformatics platform that offers a comprehensive and extendible collection of tools for the management, analysis, visualization and annotation of biomedical data. It provides biomedical researchers with a user-friendly software application that automates analysis of disparate data types.</p> 
    <p>Some key geWorkbench features include:</p> 
    <p>Support for a variety of genomic data including microarrays, sequences, pathways, networks, alignments and phenotypes.</p> 
    <p>&#12290; Data loading from both local and remote sources.</p> 
    <p>&#12290; Access to remote servers and clusters for the performance of computationally intensive calculations.</p> 
    <p><a name="_Basic_Usage"></a>&#12290; Integration of analyses with biological annotations from the National Cancer Institute.</p> 
    <p>The application Graphical User Interface (GUI) window is divided into four areas:</p> 
    <p>1. <b>Project Area </b>&#8211; management of loaded data and analysis results.</p> 
    <p>2. <b>Selection Area </b>&#8211; grouping of markers/microarrays (these groupings control the amount of data displayed in the Visual Area).</p> 
    <p>3. <b>Visual Area </b>&#8211; visualization and annotation of loaded data.</p> 
    <p>4. <b>Analysis Area </b>&#8211; filtering, normalizer and analysis tools.</p> 
    <h3><img src="images/image001.png" width="785" height="658"></h3> 
    <p>These areas are described in more detail in the applicable topic section of online help.</p> 
    <p><b>About areas and components</b> </p> 
    <p>Each of the four GUI areas contains one or more components. The following describes how areas and components can be manipulated: </p> 
    <p>&#12290; To resize an area continuously, click on an edge of that area's frame and drag the mouse left/right or up/down. </p> 
    <p>&#12290; To resize an area discretely (maximize/minimize), click on the triangular-shaped wedges located within the separators between panels. Maximizing a panel fills the entire window vertically or horizontally, and minimizes the adjacent panel. </p>

    <p>&#12290; Within an area, individual components can gain focus by selecting their corresponding tab. Alternatively, click on F12 to bring up the Keyboard Navigation window; typing the first few letters of a component name in the Search box. Double click on the highlighted component name and the application will display the component selected within its host GUI area.</p>

    <p>&#12290; To scroll the across folder tabs, click on the triangular wedges at the right of the folder tabs. </p> 
    <p><img width="314" height="68" src="caWorkbench%20introduction_files/image004.gif"></p> 
    <p>&#12290; Each component within an area is resizable and detachable. Resizing can be either continuous or discrete (maximizing/minimizing). Panel Control Buttons: The top of each panels includes the following:</p> 
    <p>1. The <b>Undock</b> button is an arrow pointing up and to the right. Clicking on the <b>Undock </b>icon detaches the component. In the detached component, the <b>Dock</b> icon is a left -downward arrow. Clicking on the <b>Dock</b> icon reattaches the panel within its GUI area.</p> 
    <p>2. The <b>Minimize</b> button is a minus sign. Clicking on it hides the component and replaces it with an icon at the bottom of the screen. Clicking on the icon restores the component to its docked/undocked position.</p> 
    <p>3. The <b>Close </b>button is an X. Clicking on the X closes the component. The component can be restored by restating the application.</p> 
    <p><img width="140" height="159" src="caWorkbench%20introduction_files/image005.jpg"></p> 
    <p>4. Window Control Buttons: On the right of the Title Bar, buttons control window functions (Minimize, Maximize/Restore, and Close). </p>
