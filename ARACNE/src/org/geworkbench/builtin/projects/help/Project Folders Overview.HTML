<h3>Project Folders Area </h3> 
    <p>The Project Folders Area is located in the upper-left-hand corner of the application. This centralized workspace is used to manage projects, open data files and store intermediate analysis results during a caWorkbench session. When caWorkbench is launched, an empty Workspace folder is displayed. The folder can be populated by creating a new workspace or by loading a workspace that was saved previously. </p> 
    <p><b>Workspace</b></p>
    <p>The workspace is capable of holding multiple projects, which are organized in a hierarchical or tree-like structure. The workspace can be renamed and saved in its entirety. When an object in the Workspace, such as a project folder, contains objects, like datasets or images, it is preceded with an icon. </p> 
    <p> - To view the next level down in the hierarchy, click on the &#8220;+&#8221; icon to expand the branch.</p> 
    <p> - To collapse a branch, click on the &#8220;-&#8221; icon.</p> 
    <p><b>Datasets</b></p> 
    <p>Project folders appear as child nodes immediately under the workspace node. Each project may contain several heterologous datasets. These datasets can include input (source) data and derived data (results) associated with an experiment as well as image files. Source data can be loaded from the user&#8217;s local storage or from remote servers. The grouping of datasets in project folders within caWorkbench does not change their physical storage locations. </p> 
    <p>The figure below is a Project Tree in the Project Area consisting of 2 projects: NCI Project and Columbia Project. All of the folders are open. The selected project is highlighted blue and bolded. The mouse-over displays information about the node to which it points.</p>
