<h3>Dataset History</h3> 
    <p>The Dataset History component is located in the <b>Command and Analysis Area</b> (see picture below). It is used to log the data transformations induced by data-modifying operations such as the application of filters, normalizers, etc. For example, when a dataset in the Project Folders is normalized, the Dataset History for that dataset is updated to record that event. Dataset histories are part of the workspace and are persisted when the workspace is saved with their pertinent dataset. Data in the Dataset History pane is non editable. </p>
